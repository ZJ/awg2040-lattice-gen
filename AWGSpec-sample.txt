# AWGSpec-sample.txt
#
# This file is an example of the expected format for the pulse specification.
# Throughout the spec file, lines containing only whitespace are ignored, and
# the start of a comment is indicated by a hash symbol (#).
#
# The shift between the Master AWG and Slave AWG is specified in ns, and input
# as 'SLAVE_SHIFT <value>', e.g.
SLAVE_SHIFT 131.2 # Shift by 131.2 ns
# If there are multiple lines like this, the last one is the one that applies.
# Also worth noting, the actual shift will be rounded to the nearest AWG clock
# period, e.g. if the AWG clock is 1 GHz, it will be rounded to the nearest ns.
#
# The specification of the pulse train is recorded as comma-separated values
# on a line, read in order from top to bottom. The actual duration of a given
# frequency pulse will be rounded to the nearest half period. The format of a
# given line is:
# Frequency [MHz], Amplitude [Relative [0,1]], Duration [ns], Phase [Pi [-1,1]]
# For example:
100.0, 1.0, 10.0, 0.00 # 100 MHz, full amp. for  10 ns (1 period),    in phase
200.0, 0.5,  7.3, 1.00 # 200 MHz,  1/2 amp. for 7.5 ns (1.5 periods), Pi phase
250.0, 0.8, 12.1, -0.5 # 250 MHz,  4/5 amp. for  12 ns (3 periods),  -Pi/2 phase
